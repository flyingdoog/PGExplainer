# PGExplainer
This is a Tensorflow implementation of the paper: <b>Parameterized Explainer for Graph Neural Network</b>

https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04573

<i>NeurIPS 2020</i>

## Requirements
  * Python 3.6.8
  * tensorflow 2.0
  * networkx

# Pytorch Implementations
Here are several re-implementations and reproduction reports from other groups.
Thanks very much these researchers for re-implementing PGExplainer to make it more easy to use!
